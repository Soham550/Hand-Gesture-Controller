# Hand-Gesture-Controller
A real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe and OpenCV to control a game 
# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV

## Overview
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system to control a game using hand gestures. The system recognizes gestures like *open hand* to accelerate and *closed hand* to brake, along with left/right steering using wrist positioning.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition
- Control a game using hand movements
- Modularized code for easy reuse and modification
- Developed using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV for video capturing and image processing
- MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition
